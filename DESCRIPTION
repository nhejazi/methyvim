Description: This package provides facilities for differential methylation
  analysis based on variable importance measures (VIMs), a class of statistical
  target parameters that arise in causal inference. The estimation and inference
  procedures provided are nonparametric, relying on ensemble machine learning to
  flexibly assess functional relationships among covariates and the outcome of
  interest. These tools can be applied to differential methylation at the level
  of CpG sites, to obtain valid statistical inference even after corrections for
  multiple hypothesis testing.

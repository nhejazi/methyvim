\usage{
cluster_sites(methytmle, window_size = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{methytmle}{Object of class \code{methytmle} produced from an object of
class \code{GenomicRatioSet}, but containing extra slots.}

\item{window_size}{Numeric giving the number of base pairs used to define
neighborhoods along the genome. CpG sites within this distance (bp) of
one another are denoted as neighbors. Chromosome boundaries and other
biological constraints are respected (see the documentation available
for \code{bumphunter::clusterMaker} for details).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{methytmle} with the "clusters" slot filled
       in. The "clusters" slot contains a \code{numeric} vector as long as
       the number of CpG sites. Each entry in the vector is a neighborhood
       assignment used in the estimation procedure.
}
\description{
Clustering of CpG sites to define CpG neighborhoods based on distance (bp).

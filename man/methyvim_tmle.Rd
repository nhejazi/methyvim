\usage{
methyvim_tmle(target_site, methytmle_screened, var_of_interest,
  type = c("Beta", "Mval"), corr, obs_per_covar, target_param = c("ate",
  "rr"), g_lib = c("SL.mean", "SL.glm", "SL.glm.interaction"),
  Q_lib = c("SL.mean", "SL.glm", "SL.gam", "SL.earth"),
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial"), return_ic = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_site}{Numeric indicating the column containing the screened
CpG site indices that will be looped over in TMLE procedure.}

\item{methytmle_screened}{An object of class \code{methytmle} with clustered
sites based on genomic windows containing the screened CpG site
indices column.}

\item{var_of_interest}{Numeric indicating the column index of the binarized
variable of interest, treated as an exposure.}

\item{type}{Character indicating the particular measure of DNA methylation to
be used as the observed data in the estimation procedure, either Beta
values or M-values. The data are accessed via \code{minfi::getBeta} or
\code{minfi::getM}.}

\item{corr}{Numeric indicating the maximum correlation that a neighboring
site can have with the target site.}

\item{obs_per_covar}{Numeric indicating the number of observations needed for
for covariate included in W for downstream analysis. This ensures the
data is sufficient to control for the covariates.}

\item{target_param}{Character indicating the target causal parameter for
which an estimator will be constructed and computed via targeted
minimum loss-based estimation. Currently, this is limited to the
Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Risk Ratio (RR), with routines
from the \code{tmle} package being used for the computation.}

\item{g_lib}{Character or vector of characters indicating the algorithms to
be implemented in SuperLearner if \code{tmle_type} is set to "glm".}

\item{Q_lib}{Character or vector of characters indicating the algorithms to
be implemented in SuperLearner if \code{tmle_type} is set to "sl".}

\item{family}{Character indicating the distribution to be implemented to
describe the error distribution for regressions, generally "gaussian"
for a continuous outcome and "binomial" for a binary outcome.}

\item{return_ic}{Logical indicating whether an influence curve estimate
should be returned for each site that passed through the filter.}
}
\value{
An \code{data.frame} containing the results of the Targeted Minimum
        Loss-based Estimation (TMLE) procedure for the target parameter of
        interest for a single CpG site, computed via the \code{tmle} package.
}
\description{
Computes the Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimate of the Average Treatment
Effect (ATE) or the Risk Ratio, treating DNA methylation as an outcome (Y)
and the indicated variable of interest (which ought to be binarized) as a
treatment/exposure (A), using the neighbors of a given CpG site as the
adjustment set (W).
